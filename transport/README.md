# Nigeria Public Transportation Smart Contract

## Overview

This smart contract, developed in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain, implements a comprehensive system for managing public transportation in Nigeria. It includes features for ride token management, bus operations, dynamic pricing, loyalty programs, and decentralized governance.

## Features

- **Ride Token System**: Users can mint, transfer, and use ride tokens for public transportation.
- **Bus Management**: Register buses, update their locations, and manage passenger capacity.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Implements time-based, demand-based, and special event-based pricing multipliers.
- **Loyalty Program**: Users earn and can redeem loyalty points.
- **Carbon Credits**: Track carbon credits earned through public transportation usage.
- **DAO Governance**: Allows for decentralized decision-making through proposal creation and voting.
- **Operator Management**: Register and revoke bus operators.

## Smart Contract Functions

### Token Management
- `mint-ride-token`: Mint a new ride token with dynamic pricing.
- `transfer-ride-token`: Transfer a ride token to another user.
- `use-ride-token`: Use a ride token for transportation.

### Bus Operations
- `register-bus`: Register a new bus with its route and capacity.
- `update-bus-location`: Update the location of a bus.
- `get-bus-info`: Retrieve information about a specific bus.

### Route Management
- `add-route`: Add a new transportation route.
- `get-route`: Retrieve information about a specific route.

### Pricing
- `update-base-fare`: Update the base fare for rides.
- `set-time-multiplier`: Set pricing multipliers for specific hours.
- `set-demand-multiplier`: Set pricing multipliers based on demand levels.
- `set-special-event-multiplier`: Set pricing multipliers for special events.
- `calculate-fare`: Calculate the fare based on various factors.

### Loyalty Program
- `add-loyalty-points`: Add loyalty points to a user's account.
- `redeem-loyalty-points`: Allow users to redeem their loyalty points.
- `get-loyalty-points`: Check a user's loyalty point balance.

### Carbon Credits
- `add-carbon-credits`: Add carbon credits to the system.
- `get-carbon-credits`: Check the total carbon credits in the system.

### DAO Governance
- `create-proposal`: Create a new governance proposal.
- `vote-on-proposal`: Vote on an active proposal.
- `finalize-proposal`: Finalize a proposal after its deadline.
- `get-proposal`: Retrieve information about a specific proposal.

### Operator Management
- `register-operator`: Register a new bus operator.
- `revoke-operator`: Revoke an operator's status.

### User Balance Management
- `deposit`: Deposit STX tokens into the contract.
- `withdraw`: Withdraw STX tokens from the contract.
- `get-balance`: Check a user's balance in the contract.

## Usage

To interact with this smart contract, you'll need to use a Stacks wallet that supports smart contract interactions. The contract owner has special privileges for certain administrative functions.

## Development and Testing

This contract has been developed and tested using Clarinet, a Clarity runtime packaged as a command-line tool. To set up your development environment:

1. Install Clarinet by following the instructions at [Clarinet's GitHub repository](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `clarinet check` to verify the contract's syntax.
4. Use `clarinet test` to run the test suite (tests to be implemented).

## Security Considerations

This smart contract has been developed with security in mind, including input validation and access controls. However, as with any smart contract, it's crucial to conduct thorough testing and potentially a professional audit before deploying to mainnet.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the contract are welcome. Please submit issues and pull requests to the project repository.
